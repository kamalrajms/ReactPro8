## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.

    another component.

## usestate() && Form contrlled input

    usestate is a react hook that allows you to add state (data that can change 
    over time) to a functional component.
     
    Normally , in js function ,variable disappear after the function runs, but with 
    usestate ,react remember values b/w re-render.

    syntex:

        const [state,setstate]=usestate(initialValue)

        state---- thecurrent value of the state variable
        setstate--- a function that update the  state
        initialValue--- the starting value of the state.
