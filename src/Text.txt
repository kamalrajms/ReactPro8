## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.
